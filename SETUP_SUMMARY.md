# Contact Form Email Integration - Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Done

Your contact form has been successfully refactored to send emails using **EmailJS**. Here's what changed:

### 1. **Added EmailJS SDK** (index.html)
- Added EmailJS CDN script to the HTML head section
- This loads the EmailJS library needed to send emails

### 2. **Updated Form Structure** (index.html)
- Changed `name="name"` to `name="from_name"` for EmailJS compatibility
- Changed `name="email"` to `name="from_email"` for EmailJS compatibility
- Added `<div id="form-status"></div>` to display success/error messages
- These changes ensure the form data is properly formatted for EmailJS

### 3. **Refactored JavaScript** (script.js)
- Replaced old script.js with clean, EmailJS-integrated version
- Added EmailJS initialization code
- Updated form submission to use `emailjs.sendForm()` method
- Added loading state (button shows "Sending..." while processing)
- Added success/error message handling
- Emails will be sent to: **chendrix@cchendrix.com**

### 4. **Added CSS Styling** (styles.css)
- Added `.form__status` styles for success messages (green)
- Added `.form__status--error` styles for error messages (red)
- Messages are prominently displayed and auto-hide after 10 seconds

### 5. **Created Documentation** (EMAILJS_SETUP.md)
- Complete step-by-step setup guide
- Instructions for creating EmailJS account
- Template configuration details
- Troubleshooting tips

### 6. **Backup Created** (script.js.backup)
- Your original script.js has been backed up for safety

## üöÄ Next Steps - ACTION REQUIRED

To make the email functionality work, you MUST complete the EmailJS setup:

1. **Read EMAILJS_SETUP.md** - Follow all the steps carefully
2. **Create a free EmailJS account** at https://www.emailjs.com
3. **Set up your email service** (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
4. **Create the email template** with the provided HTML
5. **Get your 3 IDs**:
   - Public Key
   - Service ID
   - Template ID
6. **Update script.js** with your actual IDs (replace the placeholders)

### Files to Update:

**script.js - Line 5:**
```javascript
emailjs.init('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'); // Replace with your actual public key
```

**script.js - Lines 114-115:**
```javascript
emailjs.sendForm(
    'YOUR_SERVICE_ID',     // Replace with your service ID
    'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID',    // Replace with your template ID
    contactForm
)
```

## üìß How It Works

   - Customer's name
   - Customer's email
   - Customer's phone
   - Service type they selected
   - Their message
6. Success message displays on the website
7. Form resets automatically
